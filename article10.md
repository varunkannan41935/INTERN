 Today i started my day by reading the book which i took in that book howard explained 
about how he become the ceo of starbucks in 1987 he went out as an entrepreneur and 
convinced investors to believe in his vision. In over 10 years starbucks become a small
business with 6 stores and 100 employess to a business with 1,300 stores with 25,000
employees,both the sales and profit have been grown more than 50 percent after that i
recalled about git by helping out my friend with git who didnt attend the git sessions
i explained him about how to install git and ssh key generation and then about git 
initialization and about how to push in git and commands which are used for that and
then i helped my friend with installing gui in centos and about the comments which are
used for installing gnome gui in centos after that i was assigned by my mentor i was
assigned to write about pos billing software from the developers point of view i wrote 
points about the billing software after that i learned about java script which is a 
light weight object oriented progrmming language it is used on both client side and 
server side that allows us to make webpages interactive,i learned about variables which
are used to store datas,keyword var is used to declare local/global variables and the
keyword let/const is used to declare block-scope local variable which are declared within
the block,which are not accessible outside the block and learned about datatypes which 
are numbers,strings,boolean,null,symbol and then about operators which are the mathematical 
symbols  that provides results based on two values operator are addition,subtraction,
multiplication,division,assignment etc and then about conditionals which are code structures 
used to test if an expression is true or false ,a very common form of conditional is 
if...else statement and then about functions is a code snippet that can be called by
other code or by itself or variable that refers to a function.when a function is 
called,arguments are passed to the function as input,and the function can optionally
return a value and then after that i worked on simple programs by using the variables
and operators on the browser console and thats how the day went
