  Today is the 17th day of the internship ,today i started my day with working on html
i worked on a webpage and made many mistakes and i learned and made many changes in my 
webpage and learned few new attributes in html and how to use them and then showed the 
webpage which i was working on and then my mentor suggested me few changes in my html 
form webpage he wanted me to set some attributes in that html form i learned about min 
attribute using which we can set min value for an element and max attribute which is to 
set max value for an element, i used  the min attribute to set min date for date input 
type,and min and max attribute to set age limit and then i learned about fieldset attribute 
which groups the attribute of same field and about the autofocus which  focuses on the
input when clicked and then we all went to the session,in todays session we recalled
about yesterdays topic about algorithm,that the algorithms are the instructions which
are given to the computers to perform a specific topic as the computers are dumb,and
we recalled about yesterdays problem which is to divide two numbers without using  
division that is its works on basis of the subtraction its like how many times the
number is subtracted from another number is the quotient and thats how it works
and after that we were given a simple algorithm and was told to find the answer for that
we all made a mistakes on that and then koushik explained about its flow and how it works
and then he gave us few problems and told us to work on it and then after the session 
i went to working on the html and then my mentor gave me few suggestions and then i 
started to work on problems given in todays session and thats how the day went
