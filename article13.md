   Today i started my day by recalling about yesterdays session topic i worked on
that topic and on the assignment given by koushik,after that i started to learn
html i recalled what i learned yesteday and worked on html tags and attributes  
and then started working on a simple webpage after that all interns went to session
in todays session we recalled about yesterdays assignment problem which is a trex 
problem,after that we were given another problem which is a bridge problem in that
it has four parts which are connected by 7  bridges we have to cross every bridge 
by touching it only one time and and we all tried every possible ways but after few
minutes koushik explined that this problem has no solution and added that it has 
128 possible ways to solve but nothing has a solution,then he explained that does 
we ever thought while solving this,thus this problem has a solution, he  added that
this problem will have  a solution if it has a even vertex, then he explained about
eulers cycle that is a connected graph contains a eularian cycle if and only if 
every vertex has even degree of bridge.After that he gave us another problem in 
eulers graph i checked the vertex  first in this problem it has about 20 vertices
and about 31 bridges and solved this problem after this he explained that mostly 
all of uses brute force method which is trail and error method,and then he explained
about algorithm,algorithm is nothing but a set of instructions for solving a task
he explained if we write every steps  for solving a problem it will make an 
algorithm,then he explained about computers and explained that computers are the most
dump,we explains a computer what to do,computers performs every task based on the
instrutions given to them which are the algorithms and then after the session i went
back to html i learned  about html links which has a tag and href attribute for link,
in links the attribute can have values like  self to open document in the same tab,
blank to open in new tab and parent and top and then the links consists like absolue
url and relative url and then in link it has link colors for visited,unvisited and 
active link and then link bookmark which is for creating a bookmark within a link
and then learned about html  images in that i learned about image maps in which we can
use images as maps to navigate to pages and about favicons which is icon which are 
located near the title of the web pages and html tables,html list which are ordered,
unordered list and about html block and inline and then worked on an example webpage
and thats how the day went
