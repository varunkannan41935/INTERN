       Its my 24th day of the internship,we all started our day with session,in todays session we recalled about the topics of this entire week,like  variables,objects,array,datatype.We were given a excersie to get clear in those topics above,like jumbled syntax and we have to arrange the syntax in a correct order and then after that we were given some example problems and told to find the output of that problems and we all learned the flow of   the programs and we type codes,and how it is executed internally and then we learned about the class.A class is nothing but a blueprint,it is used to plan the program like civil engineers have blueprints,which contains the plan like wise the class consists of all the instances of its types,it consists of two types in it,which are the properties and the function of a class,it has like two things it is used as blueprint,it is used to safeguard the data or information in it.When we open a class a constructor is created .we learned when we declare the object name and function name as same,It is   called the shadowing problem,to understand this the keyword "this" is used.And we learned what is execution stack,a stack is nothing but piling something one on top of the other,the same in execution stacking,the execution part keeps stacking till the end of the part of the execution.In any programming language,the main part is executed at first.After that it goes to the children and so on.The function declared in main can be accessed by the child.The main is the parent class of all,their functions can be called by is child functions,then after that i learned about frameworks,language and database.Frameworks are a tool for us to build a app or a web page ,it is used to compile the languages, languages used to create the code and then the   database is the collection of data,data we store to access.And  then we learned about frontend and backend the different between them is nothing,but  they use different frameworks and languages.In frontend we used to create the user interface for the app or a webpage and backend is to operate it 
after that we learned about user interface there are 4 or 5 interactions they are "touch,command line,buttons,click ".And then we learned about api - application progamming interface.for example,api is used in weather forcaste application.When we request for that api ,it responce it with the result.
And thats how the day went
