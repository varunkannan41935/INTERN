  Today i started my day with learning some more about figma ,i learned about how
to use some more features in figma i learned about using radial,angular and 
linear color mode and about smoothening the containers and using the prototyping
by connecting the links and using of the buttons for protyping like on tap or on
drag up,down etc and i learned about horizontal and vertical scrolling, at first
we select the containers which are to be scrolled and we go to the design and 
have to select the clip to window and then select the vertical or horizontal 
scrolling in the prototype option and then my mentor gave me the task to write 
about what are the features we expect in an shopping application from the mercants
side of view,he said me to write about what a mercant might expect in his app and
i wrote about the basic features like creating of product bills,creating customer
accounts,payment options,tax managing and others after that in learned about
remote login which i came to know from krishna,remote login is a facility which 
allows user to access the host system through network after that i learned about 
hyper text markup language(HTML) which is used in web page and its content
creation and about cascading style sheet which is used to style and layout webpages
after that they gave us all a awareness presentation about cyber security in the cyber
security awareness they taught us about what to do and what not  to do they taught us
how to search safely and how to use browser how the malicious files enter into our
system even by a single click by ourselves at first they explained about do s like   
they explained us to keep the system updated and about having a anti virus program in
our system always be aware of what are the permissions we gave and they added that we
shouldnt click the random things in a browser,like most of the websites we use are 
filled with malicious files we shouldnt click things which mostly appear on browser 
like ads,popups which mainly consists of malware files by clicking those we may get a 
high chance of being attacked by viruses and malwares in our system we shouldnt run 
random pendrive cause it may contain malware file and we learned about most of the 
third party websites may have trojans as they my not have secure server and we can 
avoid tracking from websites by enabling do not track me and enabling powerful ads
blocker which may prevent us from getting tracked and thats all for today
