# Day16:Article
## 22/02/2022
  Today is my 16th day in internship i started my day with learning html,i learned about html layout,
i recalled about header,navigation,section,article,footer i started working on a webpage using the 
html layouts,i learned about margin properties which is used to align and about flex property which 
sets the flexible length on flexible items,flex property makes the element flexible  which helps in
aligning the elements and i recalled about git today by explaining about it to my friend in creating
a new repository in git and then i went back to working on html i made a few changes in the html form
which i done before and learned about fieldset tag it is used to create related elements in a form 
and the legend tag is used defines the caption for the fieldset tag after that all interns went to 
session,we recalled the previous sessions topic like computational complex problems,after that we 
learned about algorithms and the importance of the algorithm,we learned that the computers are dumb,
algoithms are like instruction manual to the computers and the computers works on the basis of the
algorithms which are the instructions for them to what to do.Then we were given a task to write the
algorithm for making the robot to do a particular task,we learned a lot about what a algorithm is and
how it should be written,in that task we  all did a common mistake that is we all made the algorithm
for a particular constraint that is we wrote it for a particular room but it will not be satisfied 
for other constraints,then we learned about what is IDEAL ALGORITHM,if a algorithm satisfies all the
conditions and constraints then it  is called the ideal algorithm and then i went back to learning
the html and working on the web page and thats how the day went.
