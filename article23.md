      Its my 23rd day of internship i started my day with recalling and discussing about yesterdays session and the assignment given in yesterdays 
session which was to know about datatypes of different programming languages and then after that i started working on the api server for the html form
After that we all went for the session.In todays session we were recalled about the datatypes,arrays and keywords which are taught on the yesterdays 
session and then we learned about the datatypes in other programming language and then we learned about using the datatypes in a program and then the syntax for declaring datatypes then we learned about typescript and its syntax is quite different like "add():number".Here add is function name,      arguments are given inside the brackets,number is the return type,then we learned about function and its declaration is has two phases which are      "1.Declaration,2.Execution ",function which is declared will works only if it is called,if you did not call a function but you wrote even a 100       functions,it will not execute,functions returns the output for the data which is declared in the declaretion phase at the execution phase,then we
learned about objects and to represent a object, the arguments are passed in the {}.The value should be like the a key :value.we learned about the    string properties,if anything is given between the ""then it is taken as a string,and we learned  arrays/list array is a collection of data,elements 
in a array can be called using the array index, array can be decalared inside a array and after the session i worked on the server and then after that
i recalled a little bit of javascript which i learned before and thats how the day went
