about html formatting,html contains several elements for defining text with a special
meaning,html contains formatting elements <b> for bold text,<strong> important text,<i>italictext,

html comments which is to note or remind any function in html code and then about html colors,
html colors are specified with predefined color names and then about css,cascading style sheet
is used to format the layout of a webpage,with css we can control the color,font,the text size
and much more css can be added to html documents in 3 ways which are inline,internal,external
inline is by using the style attribute inside html element,internal is by using style element
in the head section and then external is by using a link to link ta an external css file after
