      Today is my 11th day of internship,i started my day with recalling figma by explaining
it to my friend i explained him about frame selection,group selection and about scrolling
the objects by selecting them into group and them connecting them together by prototype
and then select scrolling and then after that i learned about what software is,software gives
instruction that tell a computer what to do,the instructions are given by human using keyboard
or any input device,when an instruction is given the compiler converts it from  high level
language to low level language which are 0s and 1s and then i learned about compiler,the very
first compiler was written from assembler and machine code-which was the version 1 of compiler 
then version 1 of the compiler is used to compile version 2 after that i learned about HTML-
Hyper Text Markup Language is a code that is used to structure a webpage and its content,it
makes up the layout and structure for your website,this language is dynamic and allows you to
create a website using less code,generally a html code consists of a declaration <!doctype html>
that defines it is a html document and then <html> root element of an html page and then <head>
which has meta information about the html,<title> specifies titles of html page and then after 
that i learned about HTML element,an html element is defined by a start tag,some content and 
then en end tag and then HTML links,they are defined by <a> tag,the links destination is 
specified in href tag,HTML images,they are defined with <img> tag <img src="img.jpg"alt="image">
in this src is the source file and the alt specifies the alternative text for an area if the
image cannot be displayed,HTML tags<h> which denotes heading,<p> denotes paragarph,<br> which
is for line break,<a> is for hyper link,<img> for image,<hr> for horizontal rule,<br> for line
break,then after that HTML attributes all html elements can have attributes,attributes provides
additional information about elements,attributes are always specified in the start tag,it
usually come in name/value pairs,and then learned about HTML styles style="color:red;",style
="font-size:50px;",here the color red is used for define color and font size is for define the
size of the font and then learned about defining background color,fontfamily is for the font of 
text and learned about how to align text and about html text formatting and quotations and then 
we,interns went to the second floor for session in todays session we learned about propositions,
proposition and proposition logics which are conjunction,disjunction and negation and then about
the logical implecation and about biconditional staments and thats how the day went
