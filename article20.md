# Day20:Article
## 28/02/2022
   Today is the  20th day of internship i started my day with recalling of javascript
basics which i learned yesterday i recalled about for loop,it initializes the initial
expression first and then the condition is evaluated until the condition becomes false
and then i learned about while and do while loop,in while loop the condition inside
the loop executed first if the condition is true the code inside the loop starts to
execute,this continues until the condition becomes false then after that i learned 
about do while in this the body of the loop is executed at first,then the condition
is evaluted,if the condition executes to true the condition inside the do is executed
this continues until the condition evalutes to false,for loop is usually used when the
number of iteration is known and while is used when the number of iterations are unknown
then learned about break ,break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately
when it is encountered,and then about the continue statement which is used to skip the
current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the program goes to the next 
iteration and then i learned about switch statement,it is used in decision making it
evalutes an expression and executes the corresponding body that matches the expressions
result and then all interns are given a task of creating their own language as a team
and we were discussed about that task and i continued to learn the js and thats how
the day went
