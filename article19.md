  Today is my 19th day of internship i learned about javascript comparision operators,
comparision operators compare two values and give back a boolean value as a result the
result may be eiether true or false they are used in decision making the operators are
like equal to operator which gives true as output if the inputs are equal,not equal to
operator which gives true as output if the operands are not equal and other operators
are strict equal to,strict not equal to,greater than,greater than or equal to,less than
less than or equal  to then i learned about if conditions,it is of three types which
are if,if else,and if else if else,the if statements works if the condition given is 
true and the statement is skipped if the condition is not true and then in the if else
statement if the condition in the if is false then it moves to the else part if else if
is used for three conditional blocks if the condition given in the if statement is false
it moves to the else if part and if the condition in elseif part is false then it moves
to the else part and then i learned about the for loop and then we all went to session
were we learned about responsibility,obligation and about free will,duty and dharma
responsibility is nothing but taking charge by our own choice or oue own free will,
obligation differs from responsibility in a way,in which you took a work or something  
which was told or given by others and duty is like the mid point which is one will do
it sometimes with responsiblity  or in sometimes by the influence or some other people
and then we had another session we recalled about previous sessions,we recalled about 
algorithms and then we learned about how a language works,that is every language 
contains some set of rules to perform better and to have a better communication like
wise every programming has some set of rules and conditions but the languages are 
used for communication between people and the programming languages are used for the
communication between a human and a computer and then the session ended after the session
i continued learning the for loop which is used for conditions with many iterations,
the for loop works the condition until the iteration is over and thats all for
today and thats how the day went
