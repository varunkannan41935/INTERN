BIOS(basic input/output system) initialises the hardware and make sure it with 
POST(power on self test)the main job of BIOS is to load up the boot loader and 
then the boot loader loads the kernel into memory and start kernel with a set of
parameter one of the most common boot loader is GRUB(grand unified boot loader),
which mainly used to load up the kernel after boot loader the kernel is loaded it
initialises device and its memory it loads the initialization process and then
