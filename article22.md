   Its my 22nd day of internship i learned about express javascript,i learned about ejs commands and worked on a basic api server which will get data
from the server post the data which is to create new entities or to edit already existing entity and then i worked on the language assignment given onthe session me and our group discussed about that and created base letter,symbols and numbers for our language after that we all went to session, in 
todays session we learned about what is language and how it is framed.In programming language symbols are taken from the UNICODE which are the        letters from all the language and programming languages are built using english.we learned about tokens in the programming language.They are nothing  but the identifiers,operators,punctuators,numeral literals,string literals.The expressions are a combination of tokens.we learned about the types of  keywords like async,throw,catch,const,extend,int,string,boolean etc and about what are datatypes in the programming languages .It is nothing but the  type of data,there are two types of datatypes they are primitive datatypes which are simple or basic data types and composite datatypes.The primitive datatypes are string,int,bool,double,float.The composite datatypes are nothing but the array,objects and functions.we learned about array,array is a
list of datas,anything inside a array is called elements of array,there can be more than one element in array and each can be of different datatypes
and we learned about objects,objects are the block of data they start and end with curly brackets the data inside the curly brackets are keyvalue pairs,keys in key value pairs must always be unique and then about function which is nothing but add,sub etc these are the exampls of functions.syntax forthese is like int a = 5;In this the int is the datatype, a is the identifer,= is the assiging operator,5 is the num literal and ; is the sentence     terminator.Programming language is nothing but the communicative language to communicate with computer,but with the correct form and correct syntax.
And after the session i worked on the server and thats how the day went
